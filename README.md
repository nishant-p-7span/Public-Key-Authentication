# PublicKey SSH Authentication Method.
- Normally we use `private key` generated by the cloud provider to connect to the server.
- But there is one easy way to log in to your server using password and public key...

## Client/Local configuraion:
1. Need to generate private and public key for the local. Go to the following path `C:\Users\username\.ssh`. (Here i am using windows so for it path will be this and if folder won't exist then create new.)
2. Run the following command:
  - For Windows:
    ```
      ssh-keygen
    ```
  - For Linux and Mac (Need rsa key):
    ```
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ```
4. Enter Name `But I prefer you should leave it as it is just press "enter"`, then provide appropriate passkey.

5. Now you will have two files one `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`.
6. Copy the contents of `id_rsa.pub` file.

## Server Configuration:
1. Log in to the server using normal way.
2. You are in `/home/ubuntu` path for the ubuntu based server.
3. There you will be able to find `.ssh` folder using `ls -a` command.
   ```
     cd .ssh
   ```
5. There `authorized_keys` named file open it with editor.
   ```
     nano authorized_key
   ```
7. Here paste the contents of `id_rsa.pub` to the new line.
8. Save the file and exit.
9. Now go to the local machine, open terminal and it this command:
   ```
     ssh <username>@<public-ipv4>
   ```

## Permission Denied issue:
- This issue may occure due to unable to find the key.
- While Creating key you many have changes the name of key to the `id-rsa` to something else.
- Create the key again with default name (enter enter). then follow the steps again.

# Convert Keys using PuttyGen CLI:
- convert PEM file to PPK
  ```
  puttygen yourkey.pem -O private -o yourkey.ppk
  ```
- PPK to PEM File
  ```
  puttygen server1.ppk -O private-openssh -o server1.pem
  ```
